# Weather-web-app
Instructions : 
1. On the homepage, you'll find a simple and user-friendly interface.
2. Locate the search input field where you can enter a location, such as a city name.
3. After entering your desired location, click the "Get Weather" button to trigger the weather request.
4. The app will fetch and display the current weather conditions for the specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather description.
5. If the location you entered is not found or if there's an issue with the API request, the app will display "Weather data not found. Please check the location" friendly error message.
6. To switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit), look for the unit toggle or dropdown. Select your preferred unit, and the weather data will update accordingly.

I have applied stylish CSS designs to enhance the visual appeal of the app.
this color scheme and layout are designed for a pleasant user experience. This app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Feel free to test it on various screen sizes to ensure usability.
